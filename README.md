# DataSHIELD Base Client Environment

This R project template uses the [renv](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/) for setting up a reproducible [DataSHIELD](https://datashield.org/) client side R environment.

## Usage

Start by creating your project source code repository from this template: [Creating a repository from a template](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template).

To proceed in RStudio:

1. Open this project in R studio by selecting the `project.Rproj` file.
2. If reproted by *renv* in the R console, run the `renv::restore()` to install the R packages in their specific version (as described by the `renv.lock` file).
